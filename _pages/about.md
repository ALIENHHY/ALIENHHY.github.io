I am a fourth-year bachelor student in [the School of Cyberspace Security](https://scs.njust.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST)](https://www.njust.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Zhichao Lian](https://gsmis.njust.edu.cn/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=6CZPjzcQhmzsS-IjPww!Hw==&yxsh=4iVdgPyuKTE=&zydm=QP9JvMVDx3k=). I am fortunate to have conducted research on AI governance and cybersecurity at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/zh-cn/)! And I have co-founded Nanjing Nebulorix Co., Ltd. (南京云之秘境科技有限公司) with my friends, looking forward to bring some of our interesting ideas to life!

<span style="color: red;">I am seeking a MPhil/MRes or PhD opportunity starting in Fall 2025 or Spring/Fall 2026, as well as Research Assistant/Intern or Visiting Student positions available at any time.</span> If my research interests align with yours and you are interested with my past experiences, please feel free to contact me via email at <span style="color: red;">hhynb@njust.edu.cn</span>.
