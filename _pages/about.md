Welcome to my personal website! I am a senior at the School of Cyberspace Security, Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST). My major is Cyberspace Security. I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Zhichao Lian](https://gsmis.njust.edu.cn/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=6CZPjzcQhmzsS-IjPww!Hw==&yxsh=4iVdgPyuKTE=&zydm=QP9JvMVDx3k=)!

I have co-founded *Nanjing Nebulorix Co., Ltd.*, and look forward to bringing some of our interesting ideas to life!

I am looking for opportunities at 2025 Fall, including MPhil/MRes, MSc, PhD (if possible).
