Hi, I am Haoyang, a fourth-year undergraduate student in [the School of Cyberspace Security](https://scs.njust.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST)](https://gsmis.njust.edu.cn/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=M3kK3EWHXJc6xzMaFrhOQA==&yxsh=z70ppxVSQAs=&zydm=SwsWR9zpmmw=), where I am fortunate to be supervised by [*Prof. Zhichao Lian*](https://gsmis.njust.edu.cn/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=M3kK3EWHXJc6xzMaFrhOQA==&yxsh=z70ppxVSQAs=&zydm=SwsWR9zpmmw=) and [*Dr. Shuangquan Zhang*](https://teacher.njust.edu.cn/wlkjaq/zsq/list.htm). Previously, I have interned at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/zh-cn/), mentored by senior expert *Elmer Peng*, where my [work](https://alienhhy.github.io/internships/) mainly focus on AI-driven tools, AI governance and cybersecurity. Starting September 2025, I will further my studies in [the Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at [the University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/), see you in Hong Kong!

I am seeking <span style="color: red;">Research Assistant, Intern, or Visiting Student</span> positions available <span style="color: red;">from Feb. to Aug. 2025</span>, as well as <span style="color: red;">PhD or MPhil/MRes</span> opportunities starting in <span style="color: red;">Fall 2026 or Spring/Fall 2027</span>.

Research Interests
---
* **Trustworthy AI:** particularly focus on the security of LLMs, like jailbreaking attacks.
* **AI for Everything:** Exploring data-driven methods to enhance decision-making processes.
* **Intelligent Robotics:** I have won Gold Award at the VEX Robotics World Championship.

As an undergraduate student, I am still actively exploring and shaping my research interests. I have worked on projects related to **machine learning**, **computer vision**, **federated learning** and **cryptography**, all of which I find deeply fascinating too.

<span style="color: blue;">While I am still in the early stages of gaining a deeper understanding of these fields, I am confident in my abilities and deeply passionate about broadening my expertise.</span>
