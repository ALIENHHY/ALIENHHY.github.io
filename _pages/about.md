Hi, I am Haoyang, a fourth-year undergraduate student in [the School of Cyberspace Security at Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST)](https://scs.njust.edu.cn/)<img src="NJUST.png" alt="NJUST" style="width:20px; height:20px; vertical-align:-4px;">, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [*Prof. Zhichao Lian*](https://gsmis.njust.edu.cn/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=M3kK3EWHXJc6xzMaFrhOQA==&yxsh=z70ppxVSQAs=&zydm=SwsWR9zpmmw=) and *Dr. Shuangquan Zhang*.😎 Previously, I had a wonderful time at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/zh-cn/) mentored by senior expert *Elmer Peng*. Starting September 2025, I will further my studies in [the Department of Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.cs.hku.hk/)<img src="https://ALIENHHY.github.io/_pages/HKU.png" align="center" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 19px;">, see you in HK!🤪

I am seeking <span style="color: red;">Research Assistant, Intern, or Visiting Student</span> positions available <span style="color: red;">from Feb. to Aug. 2025</span>, as well as <span style="color: red;">PhD or MPhil/MRes</span> opportunities starting in <span style="color: red;">Fall 2026 or Spring/Fall 2027</span>.🥺

Here are my <a href="https://ALIENHHY.github.io/_pages/CV_Haoyang_Hu_NJUST.pdf" target="_blank">[CV-PDF]</a>, <a href="https://ALIENHHY.github.io/_pages/胡皓阳中文学术简历.pdf" target="_blank">[中文简历]</a> and <a href="https://ALIENHHY.github.io/_pages/Transcripts-Haoyang Hu.pdf" target="_blank">[Transcripts]</a>, last updated in January 2025.

Research Interests
---
* **Trustworthy AI:** Particularly focus on the security of LLMs, like jailbreaking attacks.
* **AI for Everything:** Exploring data-driven methods to enhance decision-making processes.
* **Intelligent Robotics:** I have won Gold Award at the VEX Robotics World Championship.

As an undergraduate student, I am still actively exploring and shaping my research interests. My past research experience spans projects in ***machine learning***, ***computer vision***, ***cryptography*** and ***federated learning***, all of which I find deeply fascinating too.

[//]: # (Currently, I am leading a project on ***the security of LLMs***, developing a black-box jailbreaking attack toolkit, which is also my graduation thesis. I am also contributing to a project on ***AI application in the pharmaceutical industry***, which is nearing implementation.)

<span style="color: blue;">While I am still in the early stages of gaining a deeper understanding of these fields, I am confident in my abilities and deeply passionate about broadening my expertise.</span>
