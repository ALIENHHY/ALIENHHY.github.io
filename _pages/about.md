Hello! I am a senior at the School of Cyberspace Security, Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST). My major is Cyberspace Security. I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Zhichao Lian](https://gsmis.njust.edu.cn/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=6CZPjzcQhmzsS-IjPww!Hw==&yxsh=4iVdgPyuKTE=&zydm=QP9JvMVDx3k=). 

My research interests include AI applications and AI security.

I am currently interning at ESG Coordination Office, Tencent under the guidance of Elmerpeng, exploring AI governance, cybersecurity and privacy protection.

I have co-founded 南京云之秘境科技有限公司, and look forward to bringing some of our interesting ideas to life.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
